## Android Accelerometeter Streamer

main.py Records and send android device accelerometer data via UDP on port 5005 in the following format. 

struct {
    float x, y, z; // 12 bytes
    char time[26]; // 26 bytes
}

recv.cpp receives this data and records it to a text tile 'accel_data.txt' in the project's root directory in the following format:
<x value>, <y value>, <z value>, <Time>

send.sh is a little script to copy over the python files to the android device. Default password for the device is 'admin'. This is to avoid typing the scp command over and over

connect.sh is an ssh wrapper to avoid typing: ssh -p 5005 [ip.addr]


## Usage
1. Ensure all ip addresses and ports are correct in send.sh and main.py
2. Run ./send.sh to send python files to the android device 
    * (chmod +x send.sh to make sure it's executable)
3. Compile the C++ receiving program
    * g++ recv.cpp (on linux). Run with ./a.out
    * Build and run on visual studio
5. Run the python script on the android device to start collecting and streaming

### Notes
Not sure if shell scripts work on linux
